# Family
My foundation and my litmus test. I only build services and products I'd want my own family to use. If it's not good enough for the people I care about most, it's not good enough to ship.


# Equal Opportunity
Systems should remove barriers, not guarantee outcomes. Merit and potential shouldn't be constrained by circumstance.


# Privacy
Your data is yours, not a company's asset. You should own and control what you generate.


# Open Source
The best solutions emerge from transparency and distributed innovation, not proprietary gatekeeping.


# Open Systems
Good design eliminates the need for trust. I favor mechanisms with built-in verification over those requiring faith in institutions or individuals.

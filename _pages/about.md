I'm a passionate freethinker & disciplined engineer. I've worked in a variety of engineering roles and have contributed to a number of open source projects. Recently, I've implemented a new type of virtual machine for blockchain clients. I'm also studying hardware design, and am interested in contributing towards open hardware initiatives. Please reach out via email, I look forward to connecting.
